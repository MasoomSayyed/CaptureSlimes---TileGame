<------------------- Challenges and Solutions --------------->

The major challenge was to remove the tiles from the array and then check for null tiles and update functions accordingly.
I created some references for the current selected tiles than compared them using tags.

Another one was to get the origin for grid, I used chat GPT to find the solution so when clearing tiles it can read grid location accurately.
